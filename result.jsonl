Also it's one of those specs that is very gear dependent, meaning with bad gear, it is very very bad because of the weaknesses above. But it's also a spec that gets exponentially better once you have awesome gear because everything is focused down to a single bursty AOE attack that automatically crits and is kinetic damage so Knights can completely ignore accuracy and crit rating and stack main stat, power, and surge (which explains the 6.7k+ hits).

I added slightly less than women purely from gained experience from the internet, which increased both. I should have clarified. \n Here's the big thing, men are often the ones asking other's out. So, comparing women asking out fat men, and men asking out fat women( both attractive), in both cases they are relatively rare. However, if you add in accepting a date. In this regard, both cases rise up. In my experience, mature men and women, will both accept someone who they like personality wise, but who is on the pudgy side of things. It is hard to compare the two because current social standards have men asking out women, more often than women asking out men. I have seen very few women actually ask out the nice fat guy, but who would accept. Same with men, they wouldn't ask, but would accept.

I only get the service because it's my only option to watch the Pats every Sunday at my home base if they aren't on national TV and I don't want to get cleaned up and spend money at the bar. If I could get DirecTV (even though they suck generally) I would probably just opt for that over the PS3. Streaming TV from the internet is just not quite there yet because ISPs have no incentive to make internet speeds consistently fast and will throttle your speeds in order to manage the pipeline. \n If you have any other questions let me know.

{"results": "positive", "summary": "Basically my advise to you is to not worry or stress about it. If you are able to be relaxed and open, it'll make your roommate feel the same way. I emphasize good communication, it's pretty much key. If  any  problem arises, just talk it out respectfully and politely right away. Put yourself in her shoes from time to time, and consider if what your doing would make you uncomfortable if she was doing it to you. Just try to establish the best kind of friendship you can, and work with it. Don't be afraid to take time for yourself, and scout out places you can go to if you feel like you need to be alone. Keep in mind that if you take care of yourself first, it will usually balance out with her taking care of herself too. You're both adults now, living alone but together. It's crazy awesome fun, but a responsibility too. It'll be great, don't worry :) best of luck \n Edit: just a couple things I wanted to add, 1) with both of us starting a new life away from home and learning how to make friends, we just naturally established the idea that we'd share friends. Anytime we meet someone new, we try to introduce them and include each other in the new circle. 2) I am a very private person and was suuuper nervous about living with someone. I don't have any sisters, have never shared a room, and am more of a quality over quantity type person when it comes to building relationships with other people. So I feel like I got so, so lucky with this girl. We clicked just right and feel very naturally comfortable with each other. But sometimes, it doesn't always work out that way. Please don't ever feel shy about getting your dorm advisor involved if need be. Some of my other friends have struggled with their roommates being overly or anti-social, too nosey or too unconcerned, or just not at all compatible. These things can be fixed. Give it time to see if you can work things out once you two get to know each other, but if it just can't be, then make the changes/compromises that need to be made.

First of all, it seems like most are missing the sentence where I mention that I AM AN Asian guy who has had to endure racist taunting from people when I dated white girls.  Also, I merely pointed out stereotypes among the popular consciousness.  It doesn't mean that they're true or even politically correct -- only that they're stereotypes.  I'm an Asian guy who went to an 97% white middle school and high school, a predominantly white private university, and I was in an nearly-all-white fraternity -- and I heard plenty of stereotyping, and they fell into those two categories: nerdy, and thug.   Do me a favor (seriously) and actually read my post before attacking me.  Most of the stuff I'm talking about is from first-hand experience (like the racism I faced from white people for dating a white girl, or the stereotype comments I got from classmates, or the opinions I've gotten from my female friends about Asian guys).  I have yet to see a post saying \"I find Asian guys attractive.\" \n When I say, \"it's surprising to see a pretty, talented white girl with an Asian guy\" -- can someone please provide me an argument or an example demonstrating why I shouldn't be surprised?

Listening to her stories I always comment that the labels 'master/dom' and 'submissive' seem to be on the wrong people. She just laughs and says that is common. It seems in that crowd a lot of people get enough of one role in their daily lives, so in that scene they like to switch and either give up power or take power.

You should read up on Socrates because he would call you a fool). How can anyone be sure of anything when language, gods, and every other form of categorizing/recognizing the world, through symbols and otherwise, have been man made? Read up on Nietzsche. \n Your post just has so much unpacking that I fear I haven't even scratched the surface (one last one: you can have secular beliefs about gods, not just religious ones. For example, our views on the Greek gods are secular views since those gods are clearly fake). \n I will leave you with my category of skepticism (is this still a belief in non-belief or a thought that something is impossible to attain, both physically and otherwise?) If I had to pick one of the four choices on the \"Theism Chart\" that seems so prevalent in this thread, I would claim Gnostic Atheist (There are more than 4 choices, due to the fact that just because it isn't on the chart doesn't mean an alternative doesn't exist). I hold that all deities, here and otherwise, are an impossibility and fictitious. My level of \"belief,\" if I had to gauge it and use that word, would be faith (read: complete confidence).

{"results": "positive", "summary": "my school was dumb and taught the wrong font for ballpoints and I write like a girl now because that's better. \n If you learned cursive in school, it may be the ~wrong cursive. For some reason, my school taught a type of cursive that is closer to a sort of copperplate that is only properly legible with an itallic or flex nib. They used to teach with inkwells and dip pens and my desk at school still had the holes in it where the inkwell went, but they switched over to ballpoints yet kept the font they were teaching. So my handwriting was incredibly weird and horrible until I used a flexible nib. \n What's worse is they used a different font for boys and girls. The boys had more rounded, more bold lettering and the girls had more narrow lettering with more italics and angles. The boys' capital A, Q, O looked nearly identical. In the last year, the boys all had either super weird handwriting, or they had printed handwriting that isn't cursive at all. \n Some teachers taught in both the girls and boys school and I'd peek over to see what their handwriting looks like and theirs looked way better. They got the freedom to develop their own style and had a better default font. \n I started writing like a girl once I got out of school. And I'm damn proud of it. I took over some of the capital letters and the angled letters. \n Fountain pens gave me line variation. My S used to look like an 8 because that's how we had to write it. Now I press down slightly on my fountain pen (a Pilot falcon with flex nib) which turns that 8 into an S with  thick line for the S part and thin line for the connecting lines. \n An italic nibbed pen or stub also gives line variation and often makes your writing look better just because it looks different. \n Basically, fountain pens allow you to \"cheat\" :3", "subreddit": "LifeProTips"}

These are well-suited to low-level horizontal combat you will often encounter, and familiarizing yourself with them will teach you many tricks and techniques you can later apply against other sorts of planes. I would also advice you to actively take part in events; today's event makes Zero the master of the skies it rarely is in normal, BR-dictated random battles. You will learn a thing or two there. \n But these are all just words; you should try to find a plane you like, fly it until you master it, then move on to another plane. Most often you will find your \"next\" plane by the virtue of being shot down by so often you start to pay special attention to that plane. For me it was first the 109Fs, then it was F6Fs, then it was 190s... \n Remember, it's never just about plane, it's almost always about situational awareness, pilot skill and playing to plane's strengths and enemy's weaknesses.

{"results": "neutral", "summary": "Here it is: There are many possible academic explanations which assess the origins of homophobia. Here are a few. \n EDIT 3 : Wow, thanks for all the responses! This is exactly the kind of discussion I was hoping for! Ok, since there have been quite a few posts about this, I just wanted to add what I perceive are common justifications for homophobia, which are often confused for the origins themselves. \n It's not natural.  Some people cite to evolutionary theory to explain and describe why homophobia is \"wrong.\" They say that since two men or two women cannot have a baby together, it is not natural. This is a very weak argument, because there have been hundreds of studies on homosexuality found in nature (in other species besides humans, but especially in our ape-like cousins--like bonobos and chimps). Among humans, homosexuality is found in all cultures and with about the same frequency it is found in America. Cultural norms seem to have little influence on the incidence of homosexual behavior. \n It is a perversion.  This is really a variation of the \"it's not natural\" argument, and so there's no need to reiterate what has been said in the above, other than to say that it is the\"natural\" argument with a religious overtone. In many religions, homosexuality is called wrong, or base, or immoral (for the origins of why religious leaders might have said this in the first place, see the above origins), and these emotional markers coupled with the \"not natural\" argument creates: \"it is a perversion.\" Religion has had a huge impact on many societies--here in America, overtones of puritanism, catholicism, and christianity have dominated the cultural mindset, effecting the individual mindsets of many Americans who may not even otherwise subscribe to religious beliefs. That said, I am not trying to say that all people who are religious are automatically homophobes or bigots--I am merely trying to point out that, within the dominant religious community (i.e., \"The Church\"), homosexuality is seen as \"perverse,\" incorrectly so. \n It is against G-d's law.  This argument it presumes that the homosexual is or should be bound by the religious principles that are propounded here by the religionist. To make the logical leap that because this religionist thinks that gay marriage is against G-d's law and therefore we should not make gay marriage legal, is to attempt to encode in a secular law an idea that has purely religious purposes. Until the religionist can come up with a sound reason why society benefits by the outlawing of homosexual activity, then there is no moral basis for such a law if one accepts the principle of religious freedom as encoded in the doctrine of the separation of church and state. \n It's disgusting.  Some people are offended at the idea of homosexuality because seeing two men kissing is \"disgusting.\" They therefore justify their homophobia and their reasons against gay marriage with this outcry. There are many things that go on in society that some might consider \"disgusting,\" but we don't outlaw them just because of that. \"Disgusting\" is a subjective perspective, not an objective assertion of fact. A homosexual person might consider a heterosexual person's activities \"disgusting,\"  but if anyone thought that we should outlaw heterosexual marriage just because some homosexual people thought it was \"disgusting,\" it would be shot down as a ludicrous idea. Tolerance and respect are two-way streets, and while a person's view that certain acts are \"disgusting or gross\" is their own opinion, that should not be the basis for restricting the lifestyle choices of another.", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes"}
